# ðŸ¤— Boilerplate Pure CSS

## What is it?

Small template for small projects in pure css, html and javascript. No libraries except normalize.css

## Why use normalize.css?

Normalize.css uses the standard structure and also fixes almost all errors in it. For example, it solves the problem of displaying a form from one browser to another. Normalize.css fixes this by modifying these characteristics so that its elements appear the same in all browsers.

## How can I compile the code for production? (Optional)

If you want to get the simplified and optimized code, I personally recommend [prepros](https://prepros.io) for that task.
